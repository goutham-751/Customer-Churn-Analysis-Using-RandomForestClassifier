Customer Churn Analysis Using RandomForestClassifier
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing customer churn and building a predictive model using the RandomForestClassifier.

Overview
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to improve customer retention and optimize their strategies.

Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting customer churn, specifically leveraging the power of the RandomForestClassifier algorithm.

Dataset
While the specific dataset used in the notebook is not directly accessible through this README, customer churn analysis typically involves a dataset containing various customer attributes (e.g., demographic information, service usage, contract details, billing information) and a target variable indicating whether the customer has churned.

Methodology
The project generally follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Scaling numerical features to ensure consistent input for the model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzing customer demographics and behavior patterns.
Visualizing relationships between features and churn to gain insights.
Identifying potential key factors influencing churn.
Model Building:

Utilizing the RandomForestClassifier algorithm to build the predictive model. Random Forests are chosen for their robustness, ability to handle various data types, and good performance in classification tasks.
Model Evaluation:

Assessing the model's performance using relevant metrics such as:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve)
